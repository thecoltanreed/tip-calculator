# tip-calculator
This is a tip-calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The challenge was found on Frontend Mentor. This was an interesting challenge. I found it very satisfying getting the buttons set up and watching the mathematic calculations come in the display totals. I think the hardest thing for me on this project was just getting it to look good on multiple sizings. Specifically the right side with the tip total and those elements over there. I think my HTML could've been set up a lot better to have made all that go more smoothly. On a final note, I was a little confused as to how I should approach the custom button/input. I wasn't sure how to handle inputting the value from the custom input. I set up an event for when you hit enter, it goes in the total and then works basically the same way as the buttons.
